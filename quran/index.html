  <h1 class="page-heading">Islam</h1>
  <p>My religion plays a big role in my life. Some of you may not think religion matters all that much, and others still might practice it while not really thinking about it in any deep sense.</p>

  <p>My relationship with religion is different -- I feel like I really <em>get it</em>. I firmly believe that the "right" religion should not only help its followers attain inner peace but it should also make them a net better person. And I feel like Islam does that for me.</p>

  <p>I feel like everything I do, whether it's the work on Machine Learning, or payments or whatever it is .. at the center of all of that is the belief that I wish to better myself -- and as a result to benefit humanity at large.</p>

Think about how your understanding of the role of parents changes as you grow -- first as a kid, then a teenager and later as a parent yourself. Your understanding evolves with time. The true meaning of the verses however, does not. I make absolutely no claims that this is in any way a resemblance of the true meaning of the verses. Instead, this is really just meant to be a record for me -- a notebook of sorts, where I think over the meaning verses and try to glean valuable lessons with which I hope to apply to better myself.</p>
