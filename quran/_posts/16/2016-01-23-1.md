<div class="quran-verse">أَتَىٰ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ ۚ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ {1}
يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ بِالرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنْذِرُوا أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاتَّقُونِ {2}
خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ ۚ تَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ {3}</div>

## My understanding

To me, this serves as a reminder that God created everything on this planet &mdash; that there's no such thing as chance. You were given everything you got, and you were never going to get what you didn't.

This is incredibly empowering, and it helps me achieve a sense of peace.

That project I worked so hard on, that investment I really wanted to close .. if I try my absolute best, and I don't get it .. then it's all good.

Get up, dust yourself, and move on. Life's too short to worry about what-ifs, and what could be. Just **move on**.

It's also a useful reminder about our place in this Earth. I don't see myself as being greater than others .. I also don't see others as being better than me. At the end of the day, we were all created by God .. and that's that. I submit to God alone, and no one else. *No one can touch me.*

**TL;DR: Whether it's bad or good, it's all good.**
