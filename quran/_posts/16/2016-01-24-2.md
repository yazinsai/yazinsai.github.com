<div class="quran-verse">خَلَقَ الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ نُطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُبِينٌ {4}
وَالْأَنْعَامَ خَلَقَهَا ۗ لَكُمْ فِيهَا دِفْءٌ وَمَنَافِعُ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ {5}
وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا جَمَالٌ حِينَ تُرِيحُونَ وَحِينَ تَسْرَحُونَ {6}
وَتَحْمِلُ أَثْقَالَكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَلَدٍ لَمْ تَكُونُوا بَالِغِيهِ إِلَّا بِشِقِّ الْأَنْفُسِ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَحِيمٌ {7}</div>

## My understanding

The origin story for all humans is the same .. we were created from a mere speck. At some point, I was nothing .. you were nothing too.

Realizing that, while also keeping in mind how short life really is, it makes me wonder if I'm not taking life too seriously.. Sometimes I worry about things which, in retrospect, seem utterly ridiculous. Exams, stress, fundraising .. and even businesses don't really matter all that much in the long term for any single individual.

I remember reading a story online about how this guy argued that the secret to mastering life is to treat it as a game &mdash; [here, found it](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/02/15/how-to-master-your-life/#36318dd629d7). Turns out, it *almost* is. I just need to make sure that I'm not withering away my life doing things that don't matter.

I'd like to live this short life to the fullest (and no that doesn't mean getting high and living without rules). It means gaining experiences: it means exploring this planet by traveling alot. It means starting that business that I'd always wanted to start. It means helping people. Get those points, do it for the right reasons and #win.

God's made life easy for humans &mdash; there's animals for food and clothing, machines to help us build and make things and the Internet. To be grateful is to use these resources for the right things. To be even more grateful is to create resources that others can use to do even more.

**TL;DR: Life's short, you're lucky. Act like it.**
