<div class="quran-verse">وَالْخَيْلَ وَالْبِغَالَ وَالْحَمِيرَ لِتَرْكَبُوهَا وَزِينَةً ۚ وَيَخْلُقُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ {8}
وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ وَمِنْهَا جَائِرٌ ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ {9}</div>

## My understanding

There's a lot of things we just don't know as humans .. and that makes life alot more interesting. If I look at how alot of things function today, and this could be anything &mdash; the stock market, food, the internet, voting, whatever. All these things were built by other humans at a point in time in the past where it was not abundantly clear how they would be used (certainly not compared to today). That is to say that I, as a user of this service/technology today, have more knowledge than the person who built it at the time they built it.

I'm thus empowered to change it, to improve it using the tools we have today to optimize the task it's being used for.

God's already made it easy; he's given me power over my environment, the animals; he's furnished all the building blocks of life. It's now my turn to take that and run with it.

I find this view refreshing in many senses &mdash; when you think about the realm of possibilities for change this way, you realize that they are *countless*.

**TL;DR: The World is big. Explore it. Change it.**
