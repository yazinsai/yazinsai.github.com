  <h1 class="page-heading">16 - Surat Al Nahl</h1>

  <p>I'm not really sure why I picked this chapter to start with &mdash; it just seemed right at the time. Here's a breakdown of the different posts I've written on this chapter, broken down by verse:</p>

  <ul>
    {% for post in site.categories.16 reversed %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  {% include quran-disclaimer.html %}

</div>
