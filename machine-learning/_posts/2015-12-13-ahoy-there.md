  This is an introductory post, where I cover part of the motivation why I'm
  writing these posts. It also covers the reasons why a computer engineer, with
  absolutely no Machine Learning background has suddenly decided to give it a
  go.

Well hello. My name's [Yazin](https://twitter.com/yazinsai) and I'm a regular guy just like you. I've dabbled with a bit of code in the past, namely Ruby and PHP, but I wouldn't consider myself an expert.

Lately, I've been hearing alot about Machine Learning, and I was intrigued. One thing that I found especially interesting was [Tensorflow](tensorflow-homepage), the Machine Learning brain that Google had open sourced just last week!

This was it .. I wanted to know more. However, there's a ton of material out there on Machine Learning, and the topic can seem abit intimidating (especially with all the weird looking math functions).

I heard that the best way to learn was to teach, so I'll be documenting everything I learn here. If I don't understand something, I'll just say so -- instead of attempting to BS my way through.

So that's it, I hope you'll join me for the journey!
