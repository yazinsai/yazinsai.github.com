  This is an introductory post, where I cover part of the motivation why I'm
  writing these posts. It also covers the reasons why a computer engineer, with
  absolutely no Machine Learning background has suddenly decided to give it a
  go.

I've been super fascinated with battery technology as of late, and found this book [well-reviewed on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EPYWAG/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1) so I thought it'd be worth my while .. and it was!

### Take aways

- I had no idea that electric cars were attempted many times in the past, originally around the year 1900 (by Thomas Edison).
- Battery technology only progressed when there was an industrial need or a government grant incentivized it (versus good old serendipity).
- Best in class battery technology at the time of publication hovered around 200Wh/kg (Lithium carbonate). Technologies to look forward to include Lithium Air, Lithium Silicon and Lithium Sulphide (which could potentially reach 1000+ Wh/kg, in the territory of our good friend gasoline).
