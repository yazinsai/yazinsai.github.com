<em><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a description of my understanding of the verses in the Quran, and not the real true meaning of the verse. My understanding changes over time -- I see many things differently than I did 3 years ago, and my understanding can (nay, it should) evolve with time. Think about how your understanding of the role of parents changes as you grow -- first as a kid, then a teenager and later as a parent yourself. Your understanding evolves with time. The true meaning of the verses however, does not. I make absolutely no claims that this is in any way a resemblance of the true meaning of the verses. Instead, this is really just meant to be a record for me -- a notebook of sorts, where I think over the meaning verses and try to glean valuable lessons with which I hope to apply to better myself.</p></em>
