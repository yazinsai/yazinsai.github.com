  Answering the question: "What is my purpose in this life?"
---
<!-- This post has been migrated from the previous version of this site; maintain permalink as is -->

I've spent alot of time trying to figure out what [my goals from life]({{site.baseurl}}/why) are, and these thoughts inevitably lead to the question of purpose: 

> Why was I, Yazin, created?

Being a Muslim, I'm lucky to already have that answered for me. I say lucky because many a person has already tried to figure out their purpose, expending their entire lives in the process without finding an even remotely convincing answer. Turns out some things you just can't solve with a calculator and unlimited scribble paper. 

The Quran tells me that I was created to serve Him, God.

وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ ([Quran: S51, V56](http://quran.com/51/56))

That's it?

Yup, that's it. While it may sound incredibly limiting -- people often (mistakenly) think a nun praying in the mountains completely excluded from society. In reality however, it's quite the opposite: it's **liberating**. 

## Liberating? You're nuts.

Humor me for a second. Many people subscribe to the "make the world a better place" purpose -- the idea that we were put on this Earth to leave it in better shape than we got it. 

Well, this is an even more generic purpose than that. To serve God is, in it's essence, to do good -- with one essential difference: it takes into the account the issue of _intention_. 

Two people could do the exact same action, with very different intentions -- and yes, intentions do matter .. alot. So do feelings. So do "soft" things like honesty, kindness and charity.

## Ok, so what's your purpose again?

Remember, this purpose I mention doesn't tell you _what_ you need to do, but governs _why_ you would do it (namely, to serve God). 

Done correctly, this gives me (and Muslims, in general) an overwhelming air of peace and tranquility. Why? Because you know something that others struggle so hard to know -- you believe it at your very crux, and want to share it with the entire universe -- shout it from the rooftops, and tell every living soul.

That sense of pure _relief_ that comes with having a 100% certainty that you know _why_ you were created -- that's absolutely priceless.

And trust me when I say, it makes ALL the difference in the world.

## Islam & Muslims

Sadly, Islam is arguably the most misunderstood topic in all of life today. It's ridiculous how a religion - one that I believe in at my very core - can be stretched, and misinterpreted beyond recognition -- to the ridiculous state that we see depicted in the media today. That alone is sufficient cause for distress, but what's even more painful is that Muslim's themselves have begun to succumb to that thought.

Where Muslims would proudly identify themselves as such in the past, much the way ivy league grads always make it a point to announce their credentials at every opportunity, today speaks a very different story. You very rarely come across a person today that identifies himself/herself as a Muslim anymore -- in their attempt to "fit in".

Dare to ask for an even gloomier picture? This happens in Muslim countries too.

To that end, I feel like my purpose is to share that feeling that I hold so dear -- what I know about Islam, the _true _Islam -- beyond the physical actions to the _what-you-really-think-about-when-youre-all-alone_ Islam  .. that overwhelming sense of inner peace. The feeling that no matter how good or bad (even utterly devastating, as is often the reality that many oppressed Muslims find themselves in these days) things _will_ work out. 

That ability to make peace with anything and everything that God has planned for you. 

It's often a combination of two things: 1\. doing everything _humanly_ possible to achieve the goal that you so wish to achieve, and 2\. leaving things in God's hands. 

If things work out, then thank God -- it was for the best. If things do NOT work out (and this is where many people struggle to reconcile), then it was _also_ for the best. What? Yes. God knows best after all, and you accept that in his infinite knowledge, he knew that not giving you what you so dearly wanted is actually better for you, even though you don't realize it yet.

This belief is absolutely priceless.
